# Jenkins Pi Status Light
Custom python project to let the Raspberry pi control a 12V LED Tower light from Adafruit.

The program will use 4 GPIO outputs to send a signal to a custom made circuit board to switch 12V to the LEDS. The board is created with a few simple components like 220 Ohm resistors, N-MOSFET's and an Adafruit Perma Proto board hat for the Raspberry pi. 

Below you will find the details of the components used, the layout and elictrical schema as well as the end result.
